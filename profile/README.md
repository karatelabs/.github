Since the first version of Karate was released five years ago, we have successfully made testing fun and collaborative. <br/><br/>Our 6100 GitHub stars and adoption by the Global 2000 is clear indication that Karate is a top choice for developers, QA teams, and enterprise customers.

Karate was created by a developer - keeping Developer Experience first and foremost. We made test-scripts simpler, more readable, and maintainable by relying on an innovative combination of an interpreted DSL (Domain Specific Language), JSON support and JavaScript engine.

Staying true to our mission of making test automation fun & collaborative, we continue to invest in enhancing Developer Experience (DX).
