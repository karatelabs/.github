Karate was created by a developer - keeping Developer Experience first and foremost. We made test-scripts simpler, more readable, and more maintainable by relying on an innovative DSL (Domain Specific Language), JSON support and JavaScript engine.

Staying true to our mission of making test automation fun & collaborative, we continue to invest in elevating the Developer Experience.
